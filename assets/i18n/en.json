        "INTRODUCTION1": "Gazouillis is a french word that means babbling or chirping. These are the baby's first attempts at communicating with their environment.",
        "INTRODUCTION2": "The idea for Gazouyi was born out of the research of the Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique at the Ecole Normale Superieure, with the intention to develop brain-inspired machine learning algorithms to understand how infants learn languages. Xuan Nga, a researcher at the lab and also a mother, foresaw the extraordinary educational potential of these language learning algorithms to help families with young children. Having experienced first-hand the overwhelming uncertainty but also the immense joys of parenthood, she wanted to provide new parents with a research-backed, professionally-guided tool that would help give them the means to create a brighter future for their children. The project evolved to include research from other areas of development but the goal remained the same. This is our humble attempt at making the research available to all families without being restricted by the expensive costs associated with similar services.",
